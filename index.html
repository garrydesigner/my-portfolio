            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm an artist and graphic designer with a focus on character design and concept art. I'm also interested in graphic design. I got my first job at age 18-19 after school because of my portfolio. I highly recommend checking it out.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Skills</h2>
            <p>Digital Art and Graphics Design: I can mimic any art style based on its complexity. I think it's good quality because when lots of people are working on the same project, we need similar art styles  but for graphic design, I need knowledge about colors, fonts, and their alignment is more important, as well as keeping the artist's style, which I already have. I do use some doodles in my graphic designs, especially in childhood products like snacks or toys.</p>
            <p>I also have some knowledge about coding, especially website creation and design. You can check my portfolio website; it’s built by me. I don't consider myself a professional, but this can be helpful for startups. I utilize all available tools to make the process faster, focusing on the actual design of the website.</p>
            <p><strong>Software:</strong> Corel Draw, Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, and Clip Studio Paint.</p>
            <p>I have good knowledge of computers in general; I built one for myself when I was 17 years old. I think it helps me learn any new software efficiently, and I can troubleshoot some minor errors.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>I have experience in graphic design because my first job was as a graphic designer. As a digital artist, I'm working freelance, and I work for a studio as a webtoon artist. When it’s available, I will link it here.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Personal Note</h2>
            <p>For me… I think constantly learning is better than lying about what I know. I'm 20 years old, and I think that’s a big achievement. I'm happy to improve more and am constantly getting feedback from my senior friends.</p>
