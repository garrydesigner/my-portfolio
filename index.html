            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm a character designer, concept artist, illustrator and graphics designer. At the age of 18-19, I got hired as a designer because of my portfolio; I highly recommend checking it out.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Skills</h2>
            <p>I have the ability to mimic various art styles, regardless of their complexity. This skill is valuable, especially when multiple artists collaborate on a project and a cohesive style is necessary. In graphic design, my understanding of color theory, font selection, and alignment is crucial, alongside maintaining the unique style of the artist, which I have developed over time. I often incorporate doodles into my graphic designs, particularly for childhood products like snacks and toys.</p>
            <p>Additionally, I possess knowledge of coding, specifically in website creation and design. My portfolio website, which I built myself, showcases my skills in this area. While I do not consider myself a professional, I believe my skills can be beneficial for startups. I utilize various tools to streamline the design process, allowing me to focus on the aesthetics of the website.</p>
            <p><strong>Software Proficiency:</strong></p>
            <p>CorelDRAW, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, Clip Studio Paint.</p>
            <p>I also have a strong understanding of computers; I built my own computer at the age of 17. This experience has enhanced my ability to learn new software quickly and troubleshoot minor technical issues.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Experience</h2>

            <h2>Personal Note</h2>
            <p>I believe that continuously learning is much more valuable than pretending to know everything. At 20, I see my commitment to growth as a real achievement. Iâ€™m excited to keep improving, and I really appreciate the feedback I get from friends who are more experienced.</p>
