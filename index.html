            <p>I have the ability to mimic various art styles, regardless of their complexity. This skill is valuable, especially when multiple artists collaborate on a project and a cohesive style is necessary. In graphic design, my understanding of color theory, font selection, and alignment is crucial, alongside maintaining the unique style of the artist, which I have developed over time. I often incorporate doodles into my graphic designs, particularly for childhood products like snacks and toys.
